If your network is based on one of the official templates, you'll find the file in the Tanssi repository:</p> <ul> <li>For networks based on the EVM template: the lib.rs file</li> <li>For networks based on the Substrate template: the lib.rs file</li> </ul> <p>The following snippet is an example of how the <code>construct_runtime!()</code> section looks like.

Modules built in Substrate identify their transactions using a macro <code>#[pallet::call_index(INDEX)]</code>, where <code>INDEX</code> is a number. In the case of a built-in module, the code is located within the FRAME folder of the Polkadot-SDK repository. For example, if you want to know about the transaction names in the <code>Balances</code> module, refer to its lib.rs file and look for the function names below the <code>#[pallet::call_index(INDEX)]</code> macros.

It allows a developer to write Solidity directly in the console for testing small snippets of code, letting developers skip the project setup and contract deployment steps for what should be a quick process.  </p> <p>Since Chisel is mainly useful for quick testing, it can be used outside of a Foundry project. But, if executed within a Foundry project, it will keep the configurations within <code>foundry.toml</code> when running.  </p> <p>For this example, you will be testing out some of the features of <code>abi</code> within Solidity because it is complex enough to demonstrate how Chisel could be useful. To get started using Chisel, run the following in the command line to start the shell:</p> <pre><code>chisel\n</code></pre> <p>In the shell, you can write Solidity code as if it were running within a function:</p> <pre><code>bytes memory myData = abi.encode(100, true, \"Build with Tanssi\");\n</code></pre> <p>Let's say you were interested in how <code>abi</code> encoded data because you're looking into how to most efficiently store data on the blockchain and thus save gas. To view how the <code>myData</code> is stored in memory, you can use the following command while in the Chisel shell:</p> <pre><code>!memdump\n</code></pre> <p><code>memdump</code> will dump all of the data in your current session. You'll likely see something like this below. If you aren't good at reading hexadecimal or if you don't know how ABI encoding works, then you might not be able to find where the <code>myData</code> variable has been stored.</p> <p></p> <p>Fortunately, Chisel lets you easily figure out where this information is stored. Using the <code>!rawstack</code> command, you can find the location in the stack where the value of a variable is:</p> <pre><code>!rawstack myData\n</code></pre> <p>In this situation, since <code>myData</code> is over 32 bytes in length, the memory pointer is displayed instead. But that's exactly what's needed since you already know the entirety of the stack from the <code>!memdump</code> command.</p> <p></p> <p>The <code>!rawstack</code> command shows that the <code>myData</code> variable is stored at <code>0x80</code>, so when comparing this with the memory dump retrieved from the <code>!memdump</code> command, it looks like <code>myData</code> is stored like this:  </p> <pre><code>[0x80:0xa0]: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0\n[0xa0:0xc0]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064\n[0xc0:0xe0]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\n[0xe0:0x100]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060\n[0x100:0x120]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011\n[0x120:0x140]: 0x4275696c6420776974682054616e737369000000000000000000000000000000\n</code></pre> <p>At first glance, this makes sense since <code>0xa0</code> has a value of <code>0x64</code>, which is equal to 100, and <code>0xc0</code> has a value of <code>0x01</code>, which is equal to true. If you want to learn more about how ABI-encoding works, the Solidity documentation for ABI is helpful. In this case, there are a lot of zeros in this method of data packing, so as a smart contract developer, you might instead try to use structs or pack the data together more efficiently with bitwise code.  </p> <p>Since you're done with this code, you can clear the state of Chisel so that it doesn't mess with any future logic that you want to try out (while running the same instance of Chisel):  </p> <pre><code>!clear\n</code></pre> <p>There's an even easier way to test with Chisel. When writing code that ends with a semicolon, <code>;</code>, Chisel will run it as a statement, storing its value in Chisel's runtime state. But if you only needed to see how the ABI-encoded data was represented, then you could get away with running the code as an expression. To try this out with the same <code>abi</code> example, write the following in the Chisel shell:  </p> <pre><code>abi.encode(100, true, \"Build with Tanssi\")\n</code></pre> <p>You should see something like the following:  </p> <p></p> <p>While it doesn't display the data in the same way, you still get the contents of the data, and it also further breaks down how the information is coded, such as letting you know that the <code>0xa0</code> value defines the length of the data.  </p> <p>By default, when you leave the Chisel shell, none of the data persists. But you can instruct Chisel to do so. For example, you can take the following steps to store a variable:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Store a <code>uint256</code> in Chisel</p> <pre><code>uint256 myNumber = 101;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Store the session with <code>!save</code>. For this example, you can use the number <code>1</code> as a save ID</p> <pre><code>!save 1\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Quit the session <pre><code>!quit\n</code></pre></p> </li> </ol> <p>Then to view and interact with your stored Chisel states, you can take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>View a list of saved Chisel states</p> <pre><code>chisel list\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Load your stored state by providing the <code>chisel load</code> command followed by the ID of the state</p> <pre><code>chisel load 1\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>View the <code>uint256</code> saved in Chisel from the previous set of steps</p> <pre><code>!rawstack myNumber\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>You can even fork networks while using Chisel:</p> <pre><code>!fork https://dancebox-3001.tanssi-api.network\n</code></pre> <p>Then, for example, you can query the balance of the Alice account on the demo EVM network:  </p> <pre><code>0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55.balance\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>If you want to learn more about Chisel, download Foundry and refer to its official reference page.</p>"},{"location":"builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/foundry/#foundry-with-hardhat","title":"Foundry with Hardhat","text":"<p>Often, there will be the case where a project that you wish to integrate with has all of its setup within Hardhat, making it an arduous task to convert the entirety of the project into Foundry.

The first step is to compute the domain separator. The calculation can be seen in Moonbeam's implementation or you can check out a practical example in OpenZeppelin's EIP712 contract.</p> <p>From there, a hash of the signature and the given arguments is generated which guarantees that the signature can only be used for the call permit. It uses a given nonce to ensure the signature is not subject to a replay attack. It is similar to OpenZeppelin's <code>ERC20Permit</code> contract, except the <code>PERMIT_TYPEHASH</code> is for a call permit, and the arguments match that of the dispatch function plus the nonce.</p> <p>The domain separator and the hash struct can be used to build the final hash of the fully encoded message. A practical example is shown in OpenZeppelin's EIP712 contract.</p> <p>With the final hash and the v, r, and s values, the signature can be verified and recovered.

Although your network's native token is not an ERC-20 token, now you can interact with it as if it was a vanilla ERC-20.</p> <p>One of the main benefits of this precompile is that it removes the necessity of having a wrapped representation of the protocol token as an ERC-20 smart contract, such as WETH on Ethereum. Furthermore, it minimizes the need for multiple wrapped representations of the same protocol token. Consequently, dApps that need to interact with the protocol token via an ERC-20 interface can do so without needing a separate smart contract.</p> <p>Under the hood, the ERC-20 precompile executes specific Substrate actions related to the Substrate balances module, which is coded in Rust. The balances module provides functionality for handling the various types of balances.</p> <p>This guide will show you how to interact with UNIT tokens, the native protocol tokens for quick trial networks on the Tanssi Dancebox TestNet, via the ERC-20 precompile. You can follow along and adapt this guide to interacting with your own network.</p> <p>The precompile is located at the following address:</p> <pre><code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles.

Tanssi networks can register external assets to enable their inflow. To do so, it is necessary to establish an XCM channel with the other chain and then register one of its native assets as an external asset. Registered external assets behave, to some extent, the same way as local ones.</p> <p>The ERC-20 assets precompile allows networks based on the Tanssi EVM template to access any registered external asset through the standard ERC-20 interface. Consequently, smart contracts deployed to the network can interact with such assets as they would with any other regular ERC-20.</p> <p>The address representing the ERC-20 contract is formed with the first thirty-six positions (eighteen bytes) set to the maximum value and the last four positions (two bytes) replaced with the hexadecimal representation of the registered asset identifier:</p> <pre><code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF____\n</code></pre> <p>For example, for the asset whose ID is <code>1</code>, the last four positions must be replaced with <code>0001</code>, and for an asset with an ID of <code>10</code>, those four positions must be replaced with <code>000A</code>.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles.

The hashes of the token transfers are provided as well to assist with any debugging.</p> <p>In this section, we'll show you how to deploy an ERC-20 to your EVM network and we'll write a quick script to fire off a series of transfers that will be picked up by our SQD indexer.

The Hardhat Ethers plugin provides a convenient way to use the Ethers library to interact with the network. We'll use OpenZeppelin's base ERC-20 implementation to create an ERC-20. To install both of these dependencies, you can run:</p> npmyarn <pre><code>npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts\n</code></pre> <pre><code>yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can edit <code>hardhat.config.js</code> to include the following network and account configurations for our network. You can replace the demo EVM network values with the respective parameters for your own Tanssi-powered EVM network which can be found at apps.tanssi.network.</p> hardhat.config.js <pre><code>// 1. Import the Ethers plugin required to interact with the contract\nrequire('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers');\n\n// 2.

For this tutorial, we'll be accessing the <code>events</code> specifically.</p>"},{"location":"builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/#configure-the-processor","title":"Configure the Processor","text":"<p>The <code>processor.ts</code> file tells SQD exactly what data you'd like to ingest. Transforming that data into the exact desired format will take place at a later step. In <code>processor.ts</code>, we'll need to indicate a data source, a contract address, the event(s) to index, and a block range.</p> <p>Open up the <code>src</code> folder and head to the <code>processor.ts</code> file. First, we need to tell the SQD processor which contract we're interested in. Create a constant for the address in the following manner:</p> <pre><code>export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>.toLowerCase()</code> is critical because the SQD processor is case-sensitive, and some block explorers format contract addresses with capitalization. Next, you'll see the line <code>export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()</code>, followed by <code>.setDataSource</code>. We'll need to make a few changes here. SQD has available archives for many chains that can speed up the data retrieval process, but it's unlikely your network has a hosted archive already. But not to worry, SQD can easily get the data it needs via your network's RPC URL. Go ahead and comment out or delete the archive line. Once done, your code should look similar to the below:</p> <pre><code>.setDataSource({\n  chain: {\n    url: assertNotNull(\n      'https://dancebox-3001.tanssi-api.network'\n    ),\n    rateLimit: 300,\n  },\n})\n</code></pre> <p>The Squid template comes with a variable for your RPC URL defined in your <code>.env</code> file. You can replace that with the RPC URL for your network. For demonstration purposes, the RPC URL for the demo EVM network is hardcoded directly, as shown above. If you're setting the RPC URL in your <code>.env</code>, the respective line will look like this:</p> <pre><code>RPC_ENDPOINT=https://dancebox-3001.tanssi-api.network\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's define the event that we want to index by adding the following:</p> <pre><code>.addLog({\n  address: [contractAddress],\n  topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],\n  transaction: true,\n})\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Transfer</code> event is defined in <code>erc20.ts</code>, which was auto-generated when <code>sqd typegen</code> was run. The import <code>import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20'</code> is already included as part of the Squid EVM template.</p> <p>Block range is an important value to modify to narrow the scope of the blocks you're indexing. For example, if you launched your ERC-20 at block <code>650000</code>, there is no need to query the chain before that block for transfer events. Setting an accurate block range will improve the performance of your indexer. You can set the earliest block to begin indexing in the following manner:</p> <pre><code>.setBlockRange({from: 632400,})\n</code></pre> <p>The chosen start block here corresponds to the relevant block to begin indexing on the demo EVM network, but you should change it to one relevant to your Tanssi-powered network and indexer project.</p> <p>Change the <code>setFields</code> section to specify the following data for our processor to ingest:</p> <pre><code>.setFields({\n  log: {\n    topics: true,\n    data: true,\n  },\n  transaction: {\n    hash: true,\n  },\n})\n</code></pre> <p>We also need to add the following imports to our <code>processor.ts</code> file:</p> <pre><code>import { Store } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';\nimport * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';\n</code></pre> <p>Once you've completed the prior steps, your <code>processor.ts</code> file should look similar to this:</p> processor.ts <pre><code>import { assertNotNull } from '@subsquid/util-internal';\nimport {\n  BlockHeader,\n  DataHandlerContext,\n  EvmBatchProcessor,\n  EvmBatchProcessorFields,\n  Log as _Log,\n  Transaction as _Transaction,\n} from '@subsquid/evm-processor';\nimport { Store } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';\nimport * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';\n\n// Here you'll need to import the contract\nexport const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();\n\nexport const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()\n  .setDataSource({\n    chain: {\n      url: assertNotNull(\n        'https://dancebox-3001.tanssi-api.network'\n      ),\n      rateLimit: 300,\n    },\n  })\n  .setFinalityConfirmation(10)\n  .setFields({\n    log: {\n      topics: true,\n      data: true,\n    },\n    transaction: {\n      hash: true,\n    },\n  })\n  .addLog({\n    address: [contractAddress],\n    topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],\n    transaction: true,\n  })\n  .setBlockRange({\n    from: INSERT_START_BLOCK, // Note the lack of quotes here\n  });\n\nexport type Fields = EvmBatchProcessorFields&lt;typeof processor&gt;;\nexport type Block = BlockHeader&lt;Fields&gt;;\nexport type Log = _Log&lt;Fields&gt;;\nexport type Transaction = _Transaction&lt;Fields&gt;;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/#transform-and-save-the-data","title":"Transform and Save the Data","text":"<p>While <code>processor.ts</code> determines the data being consumed, <code>main.ts</code> determines the bulk of actions related to processing and transforming that data.

For more detailed information on how SQD works, be sure to check out the SQD docs on Developing a Squid.</p> <p>Our <code>main.ts</code> file is going to scan through each processed block for the <code>Transfer</code> event and decode the transfer details, including the sender, receiver, and amount. The script also fetches account details for involved addresses and creates transfer objects with the extracted data.

Chainlink Price Feeds have stood the test of time and have wide industry adoption. As a reminder, Chainlink Price Feeds don't rely on any single source of truth, rather, their pricing data is collected and aggregated from a variety of data sources gathered by a decentralized set of independent node operators. This helps to prevent manipulation and erratic pricing data.</p> <p>The core component of Phala's system design is the Secure Enclave, which processes the inputs it receives from the Phala blockchain, acting as an encrypted message queue, and guarantees secure and faithful execution, regardless of the presence of malicious workers. In this sense, the Phala blockchain requests a price feed update, which the Phala off-chain workers fetch from Ethereum MainNet, and return to the Phala blockchain.</p> <p>It's important to note that Phala isn't limited to replicating existing Oracles. You can create entirely new Oracles by sourcing off-chain data via Phat Contracts. In this Phat-EVM Oracle example, pricing data is sourced from the CoinGecko API. Price quote updates can then be constantly streamed from the Phat contract (push design), or the EVM smart contract can ask for a refreshed quote from the Phat contract (pull design).</p>"},{"location":"builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/#fetch-price-data","title":"Fetch Price Data","text":"<p>There are several price feeds available on the demo EVM network that you can interact with.

But what is an origin? Developers from the EVM realm might be familiar with the concept of msg.sender in EVM transactions. Origins are to Tanssi networks what msg.sender is to an EVM transaction, but supercharged with many extra functionalities.</p> <p>An origin defines where the call is coming from. In contrast to Ethereum-compatible chains, there can be many origins in Tanssi networks. For example, the msg.sender of an EVM transaction is known as a signed origin, which means that the call is a transaction that was signed by some on-chain account's private key. This allows the runtime to authenticate the source of the call and, for example, charge transaction fees to the associated account.</p> <p>However, origins can do much more than represent a private key/public key pair. Origins also have different privilege levels. For example, a signed origin can send a transaction that is dispatched by the private key/public key pair but should not be able to authorize a runtime upgrade.</p> <p>Some of the most common types of origins are:</p> <ul> <li>Root - a system-level origin with the highest privilege level. It can be thought of as a superuser of the chain, which can execute any call</li> <li>Signed - as mentioned before, the origin of a transaction signed by an on-chain account's private key, which includes the account identifier (address) as the signer</li> <li>None - a lack of origin. Used in specific actions that must be agreed upon at a runtime level. For example, you can program your runtime so that a transaction with none  origin can enact a pre-authorized runtime upgrade, which means that the transaction has no fee associated with it</li> <li>Custom - developers can also create custom origins for specific use cases. For example, Moonbeam's on-chain governance has specific origins for each type of governance vote, called tracks. Consequently, each track can be configured to only execute calls with specific privilege levels. One track is Root, whose origin is the Root origin mentioned before, and has a very restrictive configuration for votes to go through. But other tracks have much lower privilege levels to do some less critical network operations</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/decentralized-networks/runtime-features/#transaction-types","title":"Transaction Types","text":"<p>Tanssi networks have three main types of transactions:</p> <ul> <li>Signed Transactions - include a signed payload requesting to execute some runtime call. Generally, the signature is associated with a private key/public key pair. Depending on the runtime logic, the account associated with the signature pays a transaction fee</li> <li>Unsigned Transactions - include an unsigned payload requesting to execute some runtime call. Because these transactions are unsigned, there is no account associated with them. Consequently, runtimes need to define specific conditions that prevent network spam or replay attacks because there is no fee mechanism to prevent such malicious behaviors. One example of an unsigned transaction is executing pre-approved actions, like a runtime upgrade</li> <li>Inherent Transactions - an unsigned transaction that a sequencer inserts into a block when initializing its construction. These transactions are part of the block and are not stored in the transaction pool or shared among network participants. In addition, the data inserted through inherent transactions can skip runtime validation, and it might be up to block validators to accept it. One example is the block timestamp. This is injected into the block by an inherent transaction, and validators can accept or reject the block based on whether the timestamp is within some acceptable range</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/decentralized-networks/runtime-features/#transaction-execution","title":"Transaction Execution","text":"<p>When a user or application submits a signed transaction to a Tanssi network, the transaction is validated at a full-node level using rules defined in the runtime, and then it is queued in a transaction pool. This ensures that only transactions that comply with certain chain-specific conditions are considered to be included in a block.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The most common type of transaction is a signed transaction. Nevertheless, unsigned transactions are also validated before they are queued in the transaction pool.</p> <p>The valid transaction queue comprises two pools: ready and future. The ready queue contains all transactions that can be included in a new pending block. The future queue is for transactions that don't meet all the criteria to be included now but might become valid. For example, transactions with a future nonce. Invalid transactions are directly rejected.</p> <p>During the block-building process, a sequencer uses a priority system through a transaction orchestration module to order transactions for the next block, until the block reaches its maximum capacity. The block building and execution order has the following operations:</p> <ul> <li>Initializing a Block - known as <code>on_initialize</code>,  enables you to define runtime logic executed before any other transaction is accounted for. For example, inherent transactions, like the timestamp in the previous example, are commonly executed when initializing a block. Once the initialization logic is completed, the transaction orchestration module verifies the parent hash in the block header and the trie root to ensure the information is correct</li> <li>Transaction Execution - with the block already initialized, the transaction orchestration module executes each valid transaction according to its priority. The initial state is not cached before the execution, meaning that if one of the transactions fails mid-execution, any state changes committed up to that moment cannot be reverted, and the subsequent block will be invalid. Consequently, runtime logic should perform all necessary checks to ensure all valid transactions will succeed</li> <li>Finalizing a Block - after all queued valid transactions are executed or the block limit is reached, the orchestration module calls into each runtime module the <code>on_idle</code> and <code>on_finalize</code> functions. These two functions allow the definition of extra business logic that is automatically executed in the block finalization process. After the last <code>on_finalize</code> function is called, the orchestration module ensures that the block digest and storage root match what was calculated when the block was initialized</li> </ul>"},{"location":"learn/decentralized-networks/runtime-features/#forkless-upgrades","title":"Forkless Upgrades","text":"<p>Networks deployed through Tanssi have a thrilling feature: forkless upgrades. Forkless upgrades allow developers to change the state transition function that governs the chain without creating a network fork, as seen on Ethereum multiple times. Furthermore, if the Tanssi network is set up with an on-chain governance system, upgrades to the network can happen in a truly decentralized and trustless way.</p> <p>Forkless upgrades are made possible by storing the state transition function as a WebAssembly (Wasm) blob in both the Tanssi network itself and the Tanssi-powered network. When a new runtime is scheduled through a function call in the Tanssi-powered network, the Tanssi network validates this block, so it is notified and readies itself to validate incoming blocks using the most recent state transition function. Following a specified runtime upgrade delay period, a Tanssi sequencer on the Tanssi-powered network constructs a block that references a Tanssi network block, signaling to the Tanssi network that it can now apply the new runtime. Consequently, this new state transition function is utilized for that specific block. As all infrastructure participants at the network level employ the on-chain Wasm blob, every Tanssi network node operator can validate new blocks using the latest state transition function.</p> <p>A high-level summary of the runtime upgrade process is shown in the following diagram:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/decentralized-networks/runtime-features/#sudo-account","title":"SUDO Account","text":"<p>Tanssi networks may use a specific module called SUDO.

Therefore, SUDO can send transactions on behalf of other users without accessing their private key</li> </ul> <p>SUDO is recommended for TestNets as it allows them to swiftly make changes without the need to go through a lengthy on-chain governance process.

With this framework, you can build unique ways to handle transaction fees. For example, most transactions use a specific module called Transaction Payment. However, transaction fees on Tanssi-powered EVM-compatible networks can be charged at an EVM execution level, bypassing other fee-related modules.</p> <p>Under the hood, for execution time, instead of working with a gas-based mechanism, all Tanssi networks work with a weight-based mechanism. Weight refers to the time (in picoseconds) it takes to validate a block. Generally speaking, for both EVM and non-EVM Tanssi networks, all function calls have a weight associated with them, which sets limits on storage input/output and computation. For Tanssi EVM networks, there is a gas-to-weight mapping that fully complies with the expected gas requirements for Ethereum API-based tools.</p> <p>A transaction fee scheme is applied on top of the weight-based mechanism to ensure economic incentives are in line to limit the execution time, computation, and number of calls (database read/writes) to perform operations. Transaction fees are fundamental to preventing network spam, as they represent the cost of using the Tanssi network service. Consequently, a user interacting with the network through a specific function call will pay a transaction fee determined by a baseline fee algorithm.</p> <p>This page covers the fundamentals of transaction fees for Tanssi networks. It first covers the underlying transaction fee architecture and how it is adapted to a fully EIP-1559-compliant model for Tanssi EVM networks.</p>"},{"location":"learn/decentralized-networks/tx-fees/#baseline-fees","title":"Baseline Fees Calculation","text":"<p>Every action that alters the state of a Tanssi network incurs a transaction fee.

Weight is divided into two separate variables:</p> <ul> <li><code>refTime</code> - corresponds to the weight associated with computation time and database reads/writes</li> <li><code>proofSize</code> - corresponds to the weight associated with the size of the Proof-Of-Validity (or PoV for short). The PoV is associated with the relevant state of a transaction, and it is what the Tanssi network sequencer shares with the security provider operators to get a block validated and finalized as part of the network transaction flow</li> </ul> <p>To find the weights for all function calls, they are benchmarked in a system with reference hardware, and the approximate values of <code>refTime</code> and <code>proofSize</code> are set. This process is repeated for all function calls that consume blockspace and affect the PoV.</p> <p>For transactions in which the fees are handled by the transaction payment module, all weight-based parameters are then passed through a weight to fee algorithm that converts all to a final value, deducted from the sender's account when executing the function call. The algorithm can be customized, but Tanssi networks have a constant value set.</p> <p>For EVM transactions, gas is converted to weight through a gas-to-weight algorithm so that all EVM calls can be mapped to block execution time.

Transaction fees are typically comprised of the following elements:</p> <ul> <li><code>BaseFee</code> - baseline cost for a transaction to be included. It accounts for the transaction inclusion overhead, like signature verification. The fee is defined by two separate parameters:<ul> <li><code>ExtrinsicBaseWeight</code> - a constant value that represents the weight of the transaction inclusion overhead</li> <li><code>WeightToFee</code> - a polynomial function that converts weight to fee</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>WeightFee</code> - fee defined by two separate parameters:<ul> <li><code>BenchmarkedWeight</code> - weight that accounts for the complexity (execution time) of a specific call</li> <li><code>CongestionMultiplier</code> - a function that converts weight to fee and can be adjusted to account for the congestion of the network (weight consumed in the previous block). The default strategy for Tanssi networks is <code>SlowAdjustingFeeUpdate</code>, which adjusts this multiplier slowly over time following the network load</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>LengthFee</code> - a fee correlated to the length in bytes of the function call. The fee is defined by two separate parameters:<ul> <li><code>ByteLengthFunctionCall</code> - length in bytes of the call being executed</li> <li><code>LengthToFee</code> - a function that defines the per-byte fee algorithm.

Such networks provide an Ethereum-like environment for developers, where they can use Eth-specific libraries like Ethers.js, Hardhat, and Foundry.</p> <p>In addition, all Tanssi EVM-compatible networks have an EIP-1559 compatible transaction pricing mechanism for EVM transactions. But they support both commonly used EVM transaction types:</p> <ul> <li>Type 0 (Legacy) - the transaction fee is calculated through a single gas price value that is included in the signed transaction blob. Because Tanssi EVM-compatible networks have a dynamic pricing mechanism, gas price must be greater than the current block's <code>baseFee</code> for a transaction to be considered valid</li> <li>Type 2 (EIP-1559) - the transaction fee is calculated with a combination of the <code>maxFeePerGas</code> and <code>maxPriorityFeePerGas</code> from the signed transaction blob, and the network's <code>baseFee</code> dynamically changes based on block congestion</li> </ul> <p>Independently of the transaction type, the outcome of all EVM transactions is that there is an associated cost in native tokens that the network must charge. </p> <p>By default, Tanssi EVM-compatible networks are configured with the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Minimum BaseFee - the minimum gas price of the network in case there are no transactions for long periods. The default value is set to 1 GWei</li> <li>Block Fulness Target (Elasticity) - the target gas used in a block so that the <code>baseFee</code> remains the same.

All Tanssi EVM-compatible networks are set with the same target</li> <li>Maximum BaseFee Increase - the maximum amount the <code>baseFee</code> can increase or decrease, in percent points, based on the previous block target usage. EIP-1559 defines this value as a constant set to 12.5%. Consequently, if the block is full/empty, the <code>baseFee</code> will increase/decrease by 12.5%, and any intermediate values are linearly adjusted.

The native cross-chain capability allows two main strategies to transfer assets from one chain to another:</p> <ul> <li>Teleport - teleporting an asset is a simple and efficient mechanism, but it has a major caveat: it requires trust between the parties. In essence, when network A wants to send X amount of assets to network B, it burns X amount of assets and sends a message to network B instructing them to mint exactly X amount of assets, preserving the overall asset balance and concluding the teleport action. In this process, network A trusts network B not to mint more tokens than what was transferred, and network B trusts network A to burn the tokens that were transferred</li> <li>Reserve transfer - A reserve transfer involves the reserve chain of an asset, which is the chain where the asset is native (e.g., Moonbeam is the reserve chain for the GLMR token). Also, non-reserve networks hold a sovereign account on the reserve chain, a keyless account managed by the respective network governor. Thus, when reserve network A wants to send X amount of an asset to non-reserve network B, it locally transfers the assets to network's B sovereign account and, in the same atomic action, it sends an XCM message to network B with instructions to mint X amount of a derivative form of the transferred asset. On the other way around, if non-reserve network B wants to send X amount of an asset to reserve network A, then the steps are: network B burns the derived form of the asset locally and sends an XCM message to network A, with instructions to transfer the assets from network B's sovereign account to network's A destination account. Even if the non-reserve network mints derived tokens in excess (or doesn't burn tokens when transferring), these tokens will have no real value because they are not backed one-to-one in the reserve chain</li> </ul> <p>The associated fees for executing transfers are typically deducted from the transferred amount, so the recipient receives the intended amount minus the fees.</p>"},{"location":"learn/framework/xcm/#remote-execution","title":"Remote Execution","text":"<p>The native interoperability XCM provides allows a network to send a message to another triggering some action.

Chain B must then accept the request by sending a corresponding XCM message to the relay chain. Only when both chains agree is the channel opened in the next epoch.

In short, each liquidity pool represents a different state throughout the staking process: joining, staking through manual rewards, staking through auto-compound rewards, and leaving. Nevertheless, one core difference is that LP tokens in common AMMs are transferable while staking shares tokens are not.</p> <p>A delegator has four simple transactions to go through the different states (liquidity pools): delegate (for manual or auto-compound rewards), undelegate, swap, and execute pending operations. For example, users who want to stake through either rewards pool can use the delegate call and join the Joining Pool immediately. After a delay, users (or anyone else) can execute the pending operation and enter the initially set rewards pool. Once there, users can swap between reward pools as often as they like. Lastly, users in a rewards pool can use the undelegate call to go into the Leaving Pool and unstake their tokens (or anyone else's) executing the pending operation after a given delay.</p> <p>Liquidity pools have a set of shares that can be considered LP tokens in traditional AMMs. When users join a new liquidity pool, they are given several shares (LP tokens) that depend on the pool type, the number of tokens they staked, the total number of shares, and the total number of tokens staked in that pool.</p> <p>Rewards are assigned to a sequencer's Manual or Auto-Compound Reward Pools when Tanssi attests that the specific block production slot that sequencer was assigned to has been fulfilled, and the block was produced successfully.</p> <p>All rewards (for all pools) are stored in a protocol-owned account. Nevertheless, the protocol internally keeps track of the actual native tokens held by each pool. The core difference between staking through the Manual or Auto-Compound Rewards Pools is how rewards are distributed. In the Manual Rewards Pool, users have to claim any staking rewards they've accumulated manually. In contrast, in the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool, the rewards are automatically re-staked at each Tanssi block, where the protocol announces the sequencer for each block production assignment.</p> <p>The delegate and undelegate operations need to be sent by the delegator itself. They signal the intent of the action to be taken and ask the protocol to perform the necessary checks to allow the delegator to delegate or undelegate. Consequently, these actions can be executed only after a certain number of sessions, but anyone in the network can perform this second operation through the execute pending operation transaction.</p> <p>The following diagram summarizes the high-level flow of a delegator delegating and undelegating tokens to a sequencer. User actions are highlighted in cyan, while different pools are highlighted in coral.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/tanssi/network-features/staking/#staking-parameters","title":"Staking Parameters","text":"Dancebox Variable Value Joining Delay 1200 blocks (2 hours) Leaving Delay 1200 blocks (2 hours)"},{"location":"learn/tanssi/network-features/staking/#staking-pools","title":"Staking Pools","text":"<p>The following section goes through each of the liquidity pools that represent a step throughout the staking process.</p>"},{"location":"learn/tanssi/network-features/staking/#joining-pool","title":"Joining Pool","text":"<p>When a user first delegates to start the staking process, it must state what staking rewards mechanism it wants: manual or auto-compound rewards (each being a separate pool).

This pool offers stability to the current set of sequencers by providing a delay between a delegator staking and receiving rewards. The delay is set to at least one entire session.</p> <p>As a practical example, Alice starts the staking process targeting the Manual Rewards Pool and enters the Joining Pool halfway through a session; she must wait until the end of the next session to execute her pending operation to start receiving staking rewards.</p> <p>Joining Pools for each sequencer have a one-to-one ratio of shares per token staked.

This mechanism tracks the historical native token per share distribution rate assigned to you by the protocol for that particular Manual Reward Pool at a specific point in time. When Tanssi attests that a block was produced by a given sequencer, new rewards are assigned to that Manual Rewards Pool for users to claim, and the rewards counter increases.

The delay allows time for the primary account that controls the proxy to review pending transactions and provides a limited period of time to cancel any actions.</p> <p>You also have the option of creating a proxy of type Any which grants the proxy account full and unrestricted control over the primary account. This means that the proxy account can transfer funds, and perform any arbitrary action.

You'll need to submit the value in Planck, so for 100, you'll need to enter <code>100000000000000</code></li> <li>Click Submit Transaction</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>A pop-up will appear for you to authorize and sign the transaction. Enter your password for the proxy account and click Sign and Submit. To confirm the delegation request, you'll need to execute the pending request after two sessions have passed. Please refer to the instructions for executing pending requests for a step-by-step guide. You can also map your session keys to your block producer account via proxy.</p> <p>After you've mapped your session keys and executed the pending delegation request, you can verify that your block producer is in the list of eligible candidates.</p> <p>That's it!
